<p style="color:red;"> Blood Girl is a turn based rpg about a vampire girl named Ketsuko hunting down her ex girlfriend who turned her into a vampire. Along the way she meets other monsters and yokai who want to kill her for various reasons. The game has a dark comedic tone where nobody reacts how they should to the violent entities around them. The game is intended for adults and older teens. Children should not play this game. </p>
<p style="color:red;"> The combat is all about timing. Block enemy high attacks, and parry enemy low attacks. Some characters the player will meet on the adventure are Tomo Chan the Bakeneko, a young and violent cat yokai who runs a shop with her sisters, Kusa San, the older one who is a Nekomata, and Hades, the youngest who is another Bakeneko. There are a few other weirdos I haven't given names to yet. </p>
<p style="color:red;"> The game will first be released on itch.io as a prototype. As a full paid release, it will be on steam and itch. There are no plans for an early access steam release. </p>

<p style="color:red;"> As for me, I'm Linus. I'm a 21 year old artist and I always wanted to make games. So I brute force learned gml in Gamemaker to make this game. I'm making this game as a first step to newer better games, my dream game is an open world 3D action game in UE. But that won't be for another buncha years. </p>
<p style="color:red;"> Blood Girl started from a random character I designed one day, Tomo Chan. From there I drew Ketsuko, and then I started coming up with backstories and personalities for them. The game is inspired by gory rpg maker horror/horror adjascent games like Yume Nikki, Wadanohara and the Great Blue Sea, Flesh Blood and Concrete, and Misao. The combat is inspired by the Mario and Luigi series with time based attacks (though I never played those lol). </p>
<p style="color:red;"> Fun fact! Blood Girl started development on Friday the 13th! Spooky! </p>
